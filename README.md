## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

3. **Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:3000`.  You can begin editing the application by modifying files within the `app` directory.  The main page is located at `app/page.tsx`.

## Project Structure
